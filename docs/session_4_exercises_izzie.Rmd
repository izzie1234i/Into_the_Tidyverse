```{r global_options,error=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message = FALSE)
```

Remember, before you can use the tidyverse, you need to load the package.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Tidy Data

Note that the sample tables used in the presentation can be accessed once the tidyverse is imported by using `table1`, `table2`, `table3`, `table4a`, and `table4b`.

#### Understanding Tidy-ness

1. Which of the following representations of the `ChickWeight` dataset is tidy? Why are the others not?

```{r echo=FALSE}
ChickWeight %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  spread(key = 'Time', value = 'weight') %>%
  rename_at(3:14, ~paste0('Day ', .)) %>%
  head()
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
ChickWeight %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  head()
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
ChickWeight %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  unite("Weight/Time", weight, Time, sep = '/') %>%
  head()
```

2. You want to create a line plot showing how mobile phone usage has changed over time in the seven main geographic regions. Which of the following tables is this easiest to do with?

```{r echo=FALSE}
WorldPhones %>% 
  as_tibble() %>%
  mutate(Year = c(1951, 1956:1961)) %>%
  select(Year, everything())
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
WorldPhones %>% 
  as_tibble() %>%
  mutate(Year = c(1951, 1956:1961)) %>%
  select(Year, everything()) %>%
  gather(key = 'Country', value = 'Number of Phones', N.Amer:Mid.Amer) %>%
  head(n = 10)
```

3. Which of the above forms is best if you just wish to view the raw data?

### Spreading and Gathering

(**Taken form R4DS**)

1. Why are `gather()` and `spread()` not perfectly symmetrical? Carefully consider the following example:

```{r}
stocks <- tibble(
  year = c(2015, 2015, 2016, 2016),
  half = c(1, 2, 1, 2),
  return = c(1.88, 0.59, 0.92, 0.17)
)
stocks %>%
  spread(year, return) %>%
  gather("year", "return", `2015`, `2016`)
```

(Hint: look at the variable types and think about column _names_.)

2. Both `spread()` and `gather()` have a `convert` argument. What does it do?

3. Why does this code fail?

```{r eval=FALSE}
table4a %>%
  gather(1999, 2000, key = "year", value = "cases")
#> Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos):
#> Position must be between 0 and n
```

4. Why does spreading this tibble fail? How could you add a new column to fix the problem? Look at the help page for `distinct()`. Could this offer an alternative solution?

```{r}
people <- tribble(
  ~name,             ~key,    ~value,
  #-----------------|--------|------
  "Phillip Woods",   "age",       45,
  "Phillip Woods",   "height",   186,
  "Phillip Woods",   "age",       50,
  "Jessica Cordero", "age",       37,
  "Jessica Cordero", "height",   156
)
```

5. Tidy this simple tibble. Do you need to spread or gather it? What are the variables?

```{r}
preg <- tribble(
  ~pregnant, ~male, ~female,
  "yes",     NA,    10,
  "no",      20,    12
)
```

### Separating and Uniting

(**Taken form R4DS**)

1. What do the `extra` and `fill` arguments do in `separate()`? Experiment with the various options for the following two toy datasets:

```{r}
tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e,f,g", "h,i,j")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"))

tibble(x = c("a,b,c", "d,e", "f,g,i")) %>% 
  separate(x, c("one", "two", "three"))
```

2. Both `unite()` and `separate()` have a `remove` argument. What does it do? Why would you set it to `FALSE`?

3. (**HARD**) Compare and contrast `separate()` and `extract()`. Why are there three variations of separation (by position, by separator, and with groups), but only one unite?

### A Practical Example

1. Import the file `olympics.csv` from this session's data folder
2. Explore the dataset using `summary()`, `head()` and `str()`
3. Recreate the following plot

```{r echo=FALSE}
read_csv("data/olympics.csv", col_types = cols()) %>%
  group_by(Team, Year, Medal) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  spread(Medal, Count) %>%
  mutate(Total = sum(Bronze, Silver, Gold, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Total, col = Team)) +
    geom_line(size = 2) +
    theme_light() +
    labs(y = "Total Number of Medals",
         title = "Olympic Medal Counts in a Selection of Eastern European Countries",
         col = "Country")
```

## Relational Data

### Built-in Datasets

1. Install the package `nycflights13` using `install.packages()` and load it with `library()`
2. Take a look at the columns of the `planes`, `flights`, and `carrier` datasets. The following diagram may help with understanding the relations.
