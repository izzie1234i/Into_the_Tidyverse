Remember, before you can use the tidyverse, you need to load the package.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Coding Basics

### R as a Calculator 1

(**Taken form R4DS**)


1. Create a sequence using the `seq()` function starting at 0 and ending at 100 assigning the output to an object called `integers`
2. Create a new vector `squares` which contains the square of every value in `integers`. Remember most mathematical functions in R act on each element individually. You might want to use the `^` operator.
3. Create a data frame with these two vectors as columns by running `tibble(integers, squares)`. Assign the output to an object called `squares_df`
4. Use `ggplot()` to produce either a scatter or line plot of these two variables (or both at the same time if you're feeling brave!)

### R as a Calculator 2

1. Calculate the sine of each value in `x` using `sin()` and assign the value to an object called `y`
2. Create a dataframe as before and plot a line graph
3. Change the line colour to any one of your choosing, set the `linetype` to `2` (dashed), and `size` to 1.5

### Specifying Parameters by Position

1. Which parameters from the following code can you use without specifying their name? 

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = factor(class)))
```

## Reading CSVs

### The 'People' Dataset

1. Read the `people.csv` file from this session's `data` folder. Make sure you specify that `sex` and `race` are factors (categorical variables) and that `earn` and `age` are integers.
2. Create a plot showing how earnings change with age. Use `geom_smooth()` to show the general trend 
3. Set the colour aesthetic in the above plot to represent the `race` variable. Include errors and set the thickness of each line to `2`

### Datasets from the Web

1. Go to the following webpage - https://gist.github.com/tiangechen/b68782efa49a16edaf07dc2cdaa855ea - which contains data on the top grossing movies between 2007 and 2011
2. Select `download ZIP` extract the CSV file (if this is causing difficulties just use the copy in the `data` folder)
3. Import this dataset into R
4. Run this code to clean up the dataset (we'll learn how to make code like this next week)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
movies <- movies %>%
  mutate(Genre = ifelse(Genre %in% c('Comdy', 'comedy'), 'Comedy', Genre)) %>%
  mutate(Genre = ifelse(Genre %in% c('Romence', 'romance'), 'Romance', Genre)) %>%
  mutate(`Worldwide Gross` = as.double(str_replace(`Worldwide Gross`, '\\$', '')))
```

5. Make a scatter plot of `Worldwide Gross` against `Audience score %` coloured by `Genre`. When using a column name with a space you need to surround the name with back-ticks (\`)

## Line geometries

### Smoothing Methods

1. Create a plot of sepal length against sepal width for each observation in the `iris` dataset colouring by species
2. Add a `geom_smooth` layer with colour mapped to Species still. Inside this call specify `method = 'lm'`. This tells `geom_smooth` to use a **l**inear **model** (straight line) for smoothing.
3. Other methods include `loess` and `gam`. See what these look like
4. If no method is specified or `method = 'auto'` is included, a method is chosen automatically. In this case, which method is used?

## Going Beyond

### Theming Graphs

1. Using the `mpg` dataset create any graph of your choosing
2. Label the graph by adding a title, caption, and axis labels
3. Add a new layer to the graph using the function `theme_minimal()`
4. Try using other themes. Type `theme_` and look at the various auto-complete options

### ggplot Objects

1. Run the following code

```{r eval=FALSE}
p <- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length, col = Species)) +
  geom_point()
```

2. What do you think this did? What will happen if we type `p`? Give it a go
3. Type the following code

```{r eval=FALSE}
p +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = 'lm')
```

4. What did that do? How can you use this to re-use code?

### Scripting

1. In RStudio, select `File > New File > R Script`
2. A new panel should open. Type the code required to generate any plot of the `Orange` dataset (Perhaps circumference against age coloured by tree. Add a trend curve if feeling confident)
3. On the top bar of the script panel select `source > source`. What does this do? 
4. Use `File > Save` to save this script somewhere. (Feel free to delete it after)
